HELLS PAVEMENT

    By John Masefield



"When I�m discharged at Liverpool �n� draws my bit o� pay,
I won�t come to sea no more;
I�ll court a pretty little lass �n� have a weddin� day,
�N� settle somewhere down shore;
I�ll never fare to sea again a-temptin� Davy Jones,
A-hearkening to the cruel sharks a-hungerin� for my bones;
I�ll run a blushin� dairy-farm or go a-crackin� stones,
Or buy �n� keep a little liquor-store"
So he said.

They towed her in to Liverpool, we made the hooker fast,
And the copper-bound official paid the crew,
And Billy drew his money, but the money didn�t last,
For he painted the alongshore blue,
It was rum for Poll, and rum for Nan, and gin for Jolly Jack;
He shipped a week later in the clothes upon his back;
He had to pinch a little straw, he had to beg a sack
To sleep on, when his watch was through,
So he did.
